## 🚀 The Problem We're Solving

In many parts of Odisha, especially in Tier 2/3 cities and rural areas, access to reliable, localized services and goods is fragmented.
*   **Consumers struggle** to find trusted local food vendors, essential kirana items, or skilled service providers (electricians, plumbers).
*   **Farmers lack direct access** to specialized veterinary care or agricultural support services.
*   **Local businesses and service providers** struggle to reach a wider customer base beyond their immediate vicinity.

This leads to inconvenience, missed opportunities, and a lack of economic empowerment for local communities.
